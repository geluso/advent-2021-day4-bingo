# Advent of Code 2021 Day 4 Bingo React Practice
Practicing bingo by practicing the bingo problem from Advent of Code 2021 Day 4.

It's been a while. What's the balance between building your own model like
my `Bingo` class and setting pieces of that model as state in React? I ran in
to the problem of manipulating that Bingo class object directly and then running

```js
this.setState({bingo: bingo})
```

But I know this is bad style.

Overall I'm happy with how this turned out and it was easy to get back in
the swing of things.

Any tips about how to use new age React hooks or anything else is appreciated too.
